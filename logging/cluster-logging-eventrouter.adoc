toc::[]

The Event Router communicates with the {product-title} and prints {product-title} events to log of the pod where the event occurs. 

If Cluster Logging is deployed, you can view the {product-title} events in Kibana. 

[NOTE]
====
Deploying the Event Router automatically enables JSON log parsing using the `MERGE_JSON_LOG` feature. For important information `MERGE_JSON_LOG`, see
xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-fluentd.html#cluster-logging-fluentd-json_cluster-logging-fluentd[Configuring log collection JSON parsing].
You must set cluster logging to the unmanaged state to use `MERGE_JSON_LOG`.
