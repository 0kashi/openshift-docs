= Running a simple {product-title} installation

From the user perspective, the process of starting up an {product-title} {product-version} cluster can be as simple as:

* Setting up a platform to run {product-title}. For example, an AWS account with DNS configured.
* Downloading the openshift-install CLI tool to your laptop or other personal computer.
* Starting the installer, providing a few key pieces of information.
* Waiting for a short period of time (possible only about 30 minutes, depending on the available resources) for the install to complete.

When the installation is complete, the results of a default installation are:

* A six-node cluster is up and running on your selected platform, consisting of three master (control plane) nodes and three worker (compute) nodes
* A set of credentials, presented by the openshift-install process, that provides you with:
* Console access: Log into the {product-title} web console from your browser to use and administer your new {product-title} cluster.
* Command-line access: Run the oc login command to access your new {product-title} cluster from the command line, to do everything from managing your cluster to building and deploying applications. Binaries of the oc CLI are https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/[available for download].
