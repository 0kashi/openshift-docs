toc::[]

As an administrator, you can view the pods in my cluster and to determine the health of those pods and the cluster as a whole.  

{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more containers deployed
together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined,
deployed, and managed. Pods are the rough equivalent of a machine instance (physical or virtual) to a container. 

You can view a list of pods associated with a specific project or view usage statistics about pods.  

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
