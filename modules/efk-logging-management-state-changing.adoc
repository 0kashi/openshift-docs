= Changing the cluster logging management state

In managed state, the Cluster Logging Operator (CLO) responds to changes in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR)
and attempts to update the cluster to match the CR.  

In order to modify the components managed by the Cluster Logging Operator,
you need to set cluster logging to _unmanaged_ state. When cluster logging is 
in an unmanaged state, the CLO does not respond to changes in the CR. 
The administrator assumes full control of individual component configurations 
and upgrades when in unmanaged state. If you make changes to a CR in managed state,
the Cluster Logging Operator can revert those changes.

[NOTE]
====
An unmanaged deployment does not receive updates until the cluster logging is placed back into a managed state.

.Prerequisite

* The Cluster Logging Operator must be installed.

* Have the name of the custom logging CR, from the `openshift-logging` project:
+

$ oc get -n openshift-logging ClusterLogging

NAME      AGE
example   48m
----

.Procedure

Edit the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) from the `openshift-logging` project:

[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
 
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
