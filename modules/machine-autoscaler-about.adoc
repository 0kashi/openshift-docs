= About the MachineAutoscaler

The MachineAutoscaler adjusts the number of Machines in the MachineSets that you
deploy in an {product-title} cluster. You can scale both the default `worker`
MachineSet and any other MachineSets that you create. The MachineAutoscaler
makes more Machines when the cluster runs out of resources to support more
deployments.
