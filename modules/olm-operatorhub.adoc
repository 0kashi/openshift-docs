= Understanding the OperatorHub

The _OperatorHub_ is available via the {product-title} web console and is the
interface that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators.
With one click, an Operator can be pulled from their off-cluster source,
installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to
self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from catalog sources of Operators grouped into
the following categories:

Red Hat Operators::
Red Hat products packaged and shipped by Red Hat. Supported by Red Hat.

Certified Operators::
Products from leading independent software vendors (ISVs). Red Hat partners with
ISVs to package and ship. Supported by the ISV.

Community Operators::
Optionally-visible software maintained by relevant representatives in the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operator-framework/community-operators]
GitHub repository. No official support.

OperatorHub itself is installed and run as an Operator by default on {product-title}.
In particular, the OperatorHub runs in the
openshift-marketplace namespace in OpenShift.

Each operator in the OperatorHub is defined by two Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):
an link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/crds/operatorsource.crd.yaml[OperatorSource] and a link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/crds/catalogsourceconfig.crd.yaml[CatalogSourceConfig]:

OperatorSource::
For each operator, the OperatorSource identifies the location of its
operator bundle. A link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/examples/operatorsource.cr.yaml[simple OperatorSource] could include:

* _type_: To identify the datastore as an application registry, type is set to appregistry.
* _endpoint_: Currently, Quay is the external datastore used by OperatorHub, so
the endpoint is set to _https:/quay.io/cnr_ for the Quay.io appregistry.
* _registryNamespace_: For a Community Operator, this is set to community-operator.
* _displayName_: Optionally set to a name that appears in the OperatorHub
user interface for the Operator.
* _publisher_: Optionally, set to the person or organization publishing
the Operator, so it can be displayed on the Operator Hub.

CatalogSourceConfig::
An operator's CatalogSourceConfig defines how an operator is installed to your
cluster. A link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-marketplace/blob/master/deploy/examples/catalogsourceconfig.cr.yaml[simple CatalogSourceConfig] would need to identify:

* _targetNamespace_: The location where the operator would be deployed and
updated, such as openshift-marketplace. This is the namespace that OLM watches.
* _packages_: A comma-separated list of packages that make up the content of
the Operator.

Although some OperatorSource and CatalogSourcConfig information is exposed
through the OperatorHub user interface, those files are only used directly
by those who are creating their own Operators.
