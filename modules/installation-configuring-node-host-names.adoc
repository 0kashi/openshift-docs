= Configuring node host names

When you set up a cluster that is not integrated with a cloud provider, you must
correctly set your nodes' host names. Each node's host name must be resolvable,
and each node must be able to reach each other node. 

.Procedure

To confirm that a node can reach another node:

. One one node, obtain the host name:
+
----
$ hostname

master-1.example.com
----

. On that same node, obtain the fully qualified domain name of the host:
+
----
$ hostname -f

master-1.example.com
----

. From a different node, confirm that you can reach the first node:
+
----
$ ping master-1.example.com -c 1

PING master-1.example.com (172.16.122.9) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from master-1.example.com (172.16.122.9): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.319 ms
