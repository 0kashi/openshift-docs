= Understanding the OperatorHub

The _OperatorHub_ is available via the {product-title} web console and is the
interface that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators.
With one click, an Operator can be pulled from their off-cluster source,
installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to
self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from catalog sources of Operators grouped into
the following categories:

Red Hat Operators::
Red Hat products packaged and shipped by Red Hat. Supported by Red Hat.

Certified Operators::
Products from leading independent software vendors (ISVs). Red Hat partners with
ISVs to package and ship. Supported by the ISV.

Community Operators::
Optionally-visible software maintained by relevant representatives in the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[operator-framework/community-operators]
GitHub repository. No official support.
