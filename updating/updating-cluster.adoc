toc::[]

You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During the {product-title} beta period, update functionality is limited in the
following ways:

* You cannot update between different beta drops, such as from OpenShift 4 Beta
Drop 2 to OpenShift 4 Beta Drop 3.
* The ability to update from a beta drop of {product-title} to a full version of
{product-title} is not guaranteed.
* After you install OpenShift 4 Beta Drop 3, you can update your cluster to
one of the available nightly builds.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
