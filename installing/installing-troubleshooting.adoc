toc::[]

To assist in troubleshooting a failed {product-title} installation, you can
gather logs from the bootstrap and control plane, or master, machines. You can also get debug information from the installation program.

[NOTE]
====
On Fedora CoreOS, SSH keys specified in the Ignition config are normally written to `/home/core/.ssh/authorized_keys.d/core`.
However, the OKD Machine Config Operator configures `sshd` to ignore that file, and manages SSH keys in `/home/core/.ssh/authorized_keys` instead.
As a result, newly provisioned OKD nodes are not accessible via SSH until the Machine Config Operator first reconciles the MachineConfig with the `authorized_keys` file.
The inoperative `/home/core/.ssh/authorized_keys.d/core` file is not deleted automatically, but may be deleted manually if the cluster administrator chooses.
