= Installing from the OperatorHub using the web console

This procedure uses the Couchbase Operator as an example to install and subscribe to
an Operator from the OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin`
permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Catalog → Operator Hub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the `Filter by keyword` box (in this case, `Couchbase`) to find the Operator you want.

. Select the Operator. Information about the Operator is displayed.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select:
.. *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to install the Operator to all namespaces or
*A specific namespace on the cluster* to choose a specific, single namespace on which to
install the Operator. The *All namespaces...* option is not always available.
.. An *Update Channel* (if more than one is available)
.. *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.

. Click *Subscribe* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on this {product-title} cluster.

. Select *Catalog → Installed Operators* to verify that the *Couchbase*
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately
resolves to *InstallSucceeded*.
+
If it does not, switch to the *Catalog → Operator Management* page and inspect
the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*. Then, check the logs in any Pods in the *openshift-operators*
project (on the *Workloads → Pods* page) that are reporting issues to
troubleshoot further.
