[id="overriding-detected-ip-addresses-host-names-{context}"]
== Overriding detected IP addresses and host names

Some deployments require that the user override the detected host names and IP
addresses for the hosts. To see the default values, change to the playbook directory and run the `openshift_facts`
playbook:

----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook  [-i /path/to/inventory] \
  playbooks/byo/openshift_facts.yml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
For Amazon Web Services, you might need to override the detected IP Addresses and host names.
====

Now, verify the detected common settings. If they are not what you expect them
to be, you can override them.
