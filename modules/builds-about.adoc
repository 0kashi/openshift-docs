= Builds

A _build_ is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting
object (build object). Most often, the process is used to transform input
parameters or source code into a runnable container image.

{product-title} uses Kubernetes by creating containers
from build images and pushing them to a container image registry.

Builds take advantage of resource restrictions, specifying limitations on
resources such as CPU usage, memory usage, and build or pod execution time. Build
objects share common characteristics including inputs for a build, need to
complete a build process, logging the build process, and publishing resources from
successful builds and the final status of the build.

The {product-title} build system provides extensible support for _build
strategies_ that are based on selectable types specified in the build API.

*The build strategies are:*

* Docker build
* Source-to-Image (S2I) build
* Custom build
* Pipeline build

*The six types of sources that can be given as _build input_ are:*

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin,openshift-dedicated[]
* Inline Dockerfile definitions
endif::[]
* Content extracted from existing images
* Git repositories
* Binary (Local) inputs
* Input secrets
* External artifacts

The resulting object of a build depends on the builder used to create it. For
Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images. For Custom
builds, the resulting objects are whatever the builder image author has
specified.

Additionally, the Pipeline build strategy can be used to implement sophisticated
workflows including continuous integration and continuous deployment.
