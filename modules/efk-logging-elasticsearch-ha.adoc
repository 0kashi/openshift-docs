= Configuring Elasticsearch for high availability

A highly-available Elasticsearch environment requires at least three Elasticsearch nodes,
each on a different host, and setting the `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` Ansible variable
to a value of `1` or higher to create replicas.

Use the following scenarios as a guide for an {product-title} cluster with three Elasticsearch nodes:

* If you can tolerate one Elasticsearch node going down,
set `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` to `1`. This ensures
that two nodes have a copy of all of the Elasticsearch data in the cluster.

* If you must tolerate two Elasticsearch nodes going down,
set `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas` to `2`. This ensures that
every node has a copy of all of the Elasticsearch data in the cluster.

Note that there is a trade-off between high availability and performance.
For example, having `openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas=2` and
`openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards=3` requires Elasticsearch to spend
significant resources replicating the shard data among the nodes in the cluster.
Also, using a higher number of replicas requires doubling or tripling the data storage
requirements on each node, so you must take that into account when planning persistent storage for Elasticsearch.

.Procedure

To configure a highly-available Elasticsearch deployment:

. Edit the Ansible inventory file, by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* to specify the number of replica shards:
+
----
openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas=3
----

. If you do not have at least 3 Elasticsearch nodes, increase the number of nodes:
+
----
openshift_logging_es_cluster_size=3
----

. Add the new nodes to the cluster with the `new_<host_type>` parameter:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
new_nodes
----

. Create a [new_<host_type>] section to specify host information for the new hosts.
+
----
[new_nodes]
node5.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-infra'
node6.example.com openshift_node_group_name='node-config-infra'
----

. Change to the playbook directory and run the scaleup.yml playbook. If your inventory file is located somewhere other than the default of *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, 
specify the location with the `-i` option:
+
----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
        playbooks/openshift-node/scaleup.yml
----
