To delete (uninstall) an Operator from your cluster, you can simply
delete the subscription to remove it from the subscribed namespace.
If you want a clean slate, you can also remove the operator CSV and
deployment, then delete Operator's entry in the CatalogSourceConfig.
The following text describes how to delete Operators from a cluster
using either the web console or the command line.
