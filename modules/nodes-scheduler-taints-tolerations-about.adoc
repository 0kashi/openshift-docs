= Understanding taints and tolerations in {product-title}

A _taint_ allows a node to refuse pod to be scheduled unless that pod has a matching _toleration_.

You apply taints to a node through the node specification (`NodeSpec`) and apply tolerations to a pod through the pod specification (`PodSpec`). A taint on a node instructs the node to repel all pods that do not tolerate the taint.

Taints and tolerations consist of a key, value, and effect. An operator allows you to leave one of these parameters empty.

.Taint and toleration components
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Parameter |Description

|`key`
|The `key` is any string, up to 253 characters. The key must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.

|`value`
| The `value` is any string, up to 63 characters. The value must begin with a letter or number, and may contain letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and underscores.

|`effect`

|The effect is one of the following:
[frame=none]
[cols="2a,3a"]
!====
!`NoSchedule`
!* New pods that do not match the taint are not scheduled onto that node.
* Existing pods on the node remain.
!`PreferNoSchedule`
!* New pods that do not match the taint might be scheduled onto that node, but the scheduler tries not to.
* Existing pods on the node remain.
!`NoExecute`
!* New pods that do not match the taint cannot be scheduled onto that node.
* Existing pods on the node that do not have a matching toleration  are removed.
!====

|`operator`
|[frame=none]
[cols="2,3"]
!====
!`Equal`
!The `key`/`value`/`effect` parameters must match. This is the default.
!`Exists`
!The `key`/`effect` parameters must match. You must leave a blank `value` parameter, which matches any.
!====

|===

A toleration matches a taint:

* If the `operator` parameter is set to `Equal`:
** the `key` parameters are the same;
** the `value` parameters are the same;
** the `effect` parameters are the same.

* If the `operator` parameter is set to `Exists`:
** the `key` parameters are the same;
** the `effect` parameters are the same.

== Understanding how to use toleration seconds to delay pod evictions

You can specify how long a pod can remain bound to a node before being evicted by specifying the `tolerationSeconds` parameter in the pod specification. If a taint with the `NoExecute` effect is added to a node, any pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately (pods that do tolerate the taint are not evicted). However, if a pod that to be evicted has the `tolerationSeconds` parameter, the pod is not evicted until that time period expires.

For example:
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 3600
----

Here, if this pod is running but does not have a matching taint, the pod stays bound to the node for 3,600 seconds and then be evicted. If the taint is removed before that time, the pod is not evicted.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-multiple-{context}"]
== Understanding how to use multiple taints

You can put multiple taints on the same node and multiple tolerations on the same pod. {product-title} processes multiple taints and tolerations as follows:

. Process the taints for which the pod has a matching toleration.
. The remaining unmatched taints have the indicated effects on the pod:
+
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule`, {product-title} cannot schedule a pod onto that node.
* If there is no unmatched taint with effect `NoSchedule` but there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `PreferNoSchedule`, {product-title} tries to not schedule the pod onto the node.
* If there is at least one unmatched taint with effect `NoExecute`, {product-title} evicts the pod from the node (if it is already running on the node), or the pod is not scheduled onto the node (if it is not yet running on the node).
+
** Pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint without specifying `tolerationSeconds` in their toleration specification remain bound forever.
+
** Pods that tolerate the taint with a specified `tolerationSeconds` remain bound for the specified amount of time.

For example:

* The node has the following taints:
+
----
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoExecute
$ oc adm taint nodes node1 key2=value2:NoSchedule
----

* The pod has the following tolerations:
+
[source, yaml]
----
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoExecute"
----

In this case, the pod cannot be scheduled onto the node, because there is no toleration matching the third taint. The pod continues running if it is already running on the node when the taint is added, because the third taint is the only
one of the three that is not tolerated by the pod.

[id="nodes-scheduler-taints-tolerations-about-prevent-{context}"]
== Preventing pod eviction for node problems

{product-title} can be configured to represent *node unreachable* and *node not ready* conditions as taints.  This allows per-pod specification of how long to remain bound to a node that becomes unreachable or not ready, rather than using the default of five minutes.

The Taint-Based Evictions feature is enabled by default. The taints are automatically added by the node controller and the normal logic for evicting pods from `Ready` nodes is disabled.

* If a node enters a not ready state, the `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoExecute`  taint is added and pods cannot be scheduled on the node. Existing pods remain for the toleration seconds period.
* If a node enters a not reachable state, the `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable:NoExecute` taint is added and pods cannot be scheduled on the node. Existing pods remain for the toleration seconds period.

This feature, in combination with `tolerationSeconds`, allows a pod to specify how long it should stay bound to a node that has one or both of these problems.

[NOTE]
====
DaemonSet pods are created with `NoExecute` tolerations for `node.kubernetes.io/unreachable` and `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready`
with no `tolerationSeconds` to ensure that DaemonSet pods are never evicted due to these problems, even when the Default Toleration Seconds feature is disabled.
