= List of feature gates

Use the following list to determine the name of the feature you want to disable:

[options="header"]
|===
| Feature gate| Description

| *AdvancedAuditing*
| Enables Advanced Audit].

| *APIListChunking*
| Enables the API clients to retrieve LIST or GET resources from API server in chunks.

| *APIResponseCompression*
| Enables the compression of API responses for LIST or GET requests.

| *BlockVolume*
| Enables the definition and consumption of raw block devices in pods. For more information, see
the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#raw-block-volume-support[Kubernetes Raw Block Volume Support].

| *CPUManager*
| Enables Container-level CPU affinity support. For more information, see Using CPU Manager.

| *CRIcontainerLogRotation*
| Enables Container log rotation for the CRI Container runtime.

| *CSIPersistentVolume*
| Enables discovering and mounting volumes provisioned through a CSI (Container Storage Interface) compatible volume plugin. For more information,
see the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/container-storage-interface.md[CSI Volume Plugins in Kubernetes Design Documentation].

| *CustomPodDNS*
| Enables customizing the DNS settings for a pod using the *dnsConfig* property.

| *CustomResourceSubresources*
| Enables */status* and */scale* subresources on resources created from CustomResourceDefinition.
See Extending the Kubernetes API with Custom Resources.

| *CustomResourceValidation*
| Enables schema-based validation on resources created from a custom resource definition.
For more information, see Extending the Kubernetes API with Custom Resources.

| *Debugcontainers*
| Enables running a debugging Container in a pod namespace to troubleshoot a running Pod.

| *DevicePlugins*
| Enables device plug-in-based resource provisioning on nodes.

| *DynamicKubeletConfig*
| Enables the dynamic configuration in a cluster.

| *DynamicVolumeProvisioning(deprecated)*
| Enables the dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes to pods.

| *EnableEquivalenceClassCache*
| Enables the scheduler to cache equivalence of nodes when scheduling Pods.

| *ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation*
| Enables annotating specific pods as critical so that their scheduling is guaranteed.

| *GCERegionalPersistentDisk*
| Enables the GCE Persistent Disk feature.

| *HugePages*
| Enables the allocation and consumption of pre-allocated huge pages.

| *HyperVcontainer*
| Enables Hyper-V isolation for Windows Containers.

| *Intializers*
| Enables the dynamic admission control as an extension to the built-in admission controllers.

| *LocalStorageCapacityIsolation*
| Enables the consumption of local ephemeral storage and the `sizeLimit` property of an *emptyDir* volume.

| *Mountcontainers*
| Enables using utility Containers on the host as the volume mount.

| *MountPropagation*
| Enables sharing a volume mounted by one Container to other Containers or pods.

| *PersistentLocalVolumes*
| Enables the usage of local volume pods.
Pod affinity has to be specified if requesting a local volume.

| *PodPriority*
| Enables the descheduling and preemption of pods based on their priorities.

| *ReadOnlyAPIDataVolumes*
| Set secrets, ConfigMaps, DownwardAPI, and projected volumes to be mounted in read-only mode.

| *ResourceLimitsPriorityFunction*
| Enables a scheduler priority function that assigns a lowest possible score of `1` to a node that satisfies at least one of the input pod CPU and memory limits. The intent is to break ties between nodes with same scores.

| *RotateKubeletClientCertificate*
| Enables the rotation of the client TLS certificate on the cluster.

| *RotateKubeletServerCertificate*
| Enables the rotation of the server TLS certificate on the cluster.

| *RunAsGroup*
| Enables control over the primary group ID set on the init processes of Containers.

| *ScheduleDaemonSetPods*
| Enables DaemonSet pods to be scheduled by the default scheduler instead of the DaemonSet controller.

| *ServiceNodeExclusion*
| Enables the exclusion of nodes from load balancers created by a cloud provider.

| *StorageObjectInUseProtection*
| Enables postponing the deletion of persistent volume or persistent volume claim objects if they are still being used.

| *StreamingProxyRedirects*
| Instructs the API server to intercept and follow redirects from the backend kubelet for streaming requests.

| *SupportIPVSProxyMode*
| Enables providing in-cluster service load balancing using IP virtual servers.

| *SupportPodPidsLimit*
| Enables support for limiting the number of processes (PIDs) running in a pod.

| *TaintBasedEvictions*
| Enables evicting pods from nodes based on taints on nodes and tolerations on pods.

| *TaintNodesByCondition*
| Enables automatic tainting nodes based on node conditions.

| *TokenRequest*
| Enables the TokenRequest endpoint on service account resources.

| *VolumeScheduling*
| Enables volume-topology-aware scheduling and make the persistent volume claim (PVC) binding aware of scheduling decisions. It also enables the usage of local volumes types when used together with the *PersistentLocalVolumes* feature gate.
