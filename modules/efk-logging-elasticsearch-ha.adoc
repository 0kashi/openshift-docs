= Configuring Elasticsearch sharding policy

You can define how Elasticsearch shards are replicated across data nodes in the cluster:

* *FullRedundancy.* The shards for each index are fully replicated to every data node.

* *MultipleRedundancy.* The shards for each index are spread over half of the data nodes.

* *SingleRedundancy.* A single copy of each shard. Logs are always available and recoverable as long as at least two data nodes exist.

* *ZeroRedundancy.* No copies of any shards. Logs might be unavailable or lost in the event a node is down or fails.

.Procedure

Edit or create the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR): 

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "clusterlogging"

....

spec:
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    elasticsearch: 
      redundancyPolicy: "SingleRedundancy" <1>
----
<1> Specify a redundancy policy for the shards.
