Pods inside of an {product-title} cluster are only reachable by their IP
addresses on the cluster network. An edge load balancer can be used to accept
traffic from outside networks and proxy the traffic to pods inside the
{product-title} cluster. In cases where the load balancer is not part of the
cluster network, routing becomes a hurdle as the internal cluster network is not
accessible to the edge load balancer.

To solve this problem where the {product-title} cluster is using {product-title}
SDN as the cluster networking solution, there are two ways to achieve network
access to the pods.
