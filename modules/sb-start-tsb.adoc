= Starting the template service broker

Once you have installed the template service broker Operator, you can start the
template service broker using the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have enabled service catalog.
* You have installed the template service broker Operator.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to *Catalog* -> *Installed Operators* and select the `template-service-broker` project.
. Select the *Template Service Broker Operator*.
. Under *Provided APIs*, click *Create New* for *Template Service Broker*.
. Review the default YAML and click *Create*.

Once the template service broker has started, you can view the available
template applications by navigating to *Catalog* -> *Developer Catalog* and
selecting the *Service Class* checkbox. Note that it may take a few minutes for
the template service broker to start and the template applications to be available.

If you do not yet see these Service classes, you can check the status of the
following items:

* Template service broker Pod status
** From the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page for the *template-service-broker*
project, verify that the Pod that starts with `apiserver-` has a status of
*Running* and readiness of *Ready*.
* Service catalog controller manager Pod logs
** From the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page for the
*kube-service-catalog-controller-manager* project, review the logs for each of
the Pods and verify that you see a log entry with the message `Successfully fetched catalog entries from broker`.
