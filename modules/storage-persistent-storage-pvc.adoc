= Persistent Volume Claims

Each persistent volume claim (PVC) contains a `spec` and `status`, which 
is the specification and status of the claim, for example:

.PVC object definition example
[source,yaml]
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myclaim <1>
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <2>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi <3>
  storageClassName: gold <4>
status:
  ...
----
<1> Name of the PVC
<2> The access mode, defining the read-write and mount permissions
<3> The amount of storage available to the PVC
<4> Name of the `StorageClass` required by the claim

[[pvc-storage-class]]
== Storage classes

Claims can optionally request a specific storage class by specifying the 
storage class's name in the `storageClassName` attribute. Only PVs of the 
requested class, ones with the same `storageClassName` as the PVC, can be 
bound to the PVC. The cluster administrator can configure dynamic 
provisioners to service one or more storage classes. The cluster 
administrator can create a PV on demand  that matches the specifications 
in the PVC.

The cluster administrator can also set a default storage class for all PVCs.
When a default storage class is configured, the PVC must explicitly ask for
`StorageClass` or `storageClassName` annotations set to `""` to be bound 
to a PV without a storage class.

[[pvc-access-modes]]
== Access modes

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with 
specific access modes.

[[pvc-resources]]
== Resources

Claims, such as pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In 
this case, the request is for storage. The same resource model applies to 
volumes and claims.

[[pvc-claims-as-volumes]]
== Claims as volumes

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the
same namespace as the pod by using the claim. The cluster finds the claim 
in the pod's namespace and uses it to get the `PersistentVolume` backing 
the claim. The volume is mounted to the host and into the pod, for example:

.Mount volume to the host and into the pod example
[source,yaml]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: dockerfile/nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html" <1>
        name: mypd <2>
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim <3>
----
<1> Path to mount the volume inside the pod
<2> Name of the volume to mount
<3> Name of the PVC, that exists in the same namespace, to use
