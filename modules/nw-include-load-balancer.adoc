= Including the load balancer in the SDN

If possible, run an {product-title} node instance on the load balancer itself that
uses OpenShift SDN as the networking plug-in. This way, the edge machine gets
its own Open vSwitch bridge that the SDN automatically configures to provide
access to the pods and nodes that reside in the cluster. The _routing table_ is
dynamically configured by the SDN as pods are created and deleted, and thus the
routing software is able to reach the pods.

.Procedure

* Mark the load balancer machine as an unschedulable
node so that no pods end up on the load balancer itself:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc adm manage-node <load_balancer_hostname> --schedulable=false
----

If the load balancer comes packaged as a container, then it is even easier to
integrate with {product-title}: Simply run the load balancer as a pod with the
host port exposed. The pre-packaged HAProxy router in
{product-title} runs in precisely this fashion.
