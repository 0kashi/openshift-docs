This document describes the process to recover from a complete loss of a master host. This includes
situations where a majority of master hosts have been lost, leading to etcd quorum loss and the cluster going offline.

At a high level, the procedure is to:

. Restore etcd quorum on a remaining master host.
. Create new master hosts.
. Correct DNS and load balancer entries.
. Grow etcd to full membership.

If the majority of master hosts have been lost, you will need a xref:../disaster_recovery/backing-up-etcd.html#backing-up-etcd-data_backup-etcd[backed up etcd snapshot] to restore etcd quorum on the remaining master host.
