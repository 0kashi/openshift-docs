= Understanding Containers in {product-title} 

The basic units of {product-title} applications are called _containers_.
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1353593[Linux container technologies]
are lightweight mechanisms for isolating running processes so that they are
limited to interacting with only their designated resources.

Many application instances can be running in containers on a single host without
visibility into each others' processes, files, network, and so on. Typically,
each container provides a single service (often called a "micro-service"), such
as a web server or a database, though containers can be used for arbitrary
workloads.

The Linux kernel has been incorporating capabilities for container technologies
for years. More recently the Docker project has developed a convenient
management interface for Linux containers on a host. {product-title} and
Kubernetes add the ability to orchestrate Docker-formatted containers across
multi-host installations.

Though you do not directly interact with the Docker CLI or service when using
{product-title}, understanding their capabilities and terminology is
important for understanding their role in {product-title} and how your
applications function inside of containers. The *docker* RPM is available
as part of RHEL 7, as well as CentOS and Fedora, so you can
experiment with it separately from {product-title}. Refer to the article
link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/881893[Get Started with Docker Formatted Container Images on Red Hat Systems] for a guided introduction.
