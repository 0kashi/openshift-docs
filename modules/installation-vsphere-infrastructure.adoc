= VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install the {product-title} cluster on a VMware vSphere version 6.5U2
or 6.7U2 or later instance.

VMware recommends using vSphere Version 6.7U2 or later with your {product-title}
cluster.
vSphere 6.7U2 includes:

* Support for VMware NSX-T
* Support for VSAN, the FCD & CSI Driver Model

While vSphere 6.5U2 with Hardware version 13 is supported, {product-title}
clusters are subject to the following restrictions:

* NSX-T SDN is not supported.
* VSAN is not supported by the {product-title} CSI Driver model.
* You must use another SDN or storage provider that {product-title} supports.

If you use a vSphere version 6.5U2 instance, consider upgrading to 6.7U2 before
you install {product-title}.
