[id='builds-strategy-custom-expose-docker-socket-{context}']
= Exposing the Docker socket

To allow the running of Docker commands and the building of container
images from inside the container, the build container must be bound to an
accessible socket.

.Procedure

Set the `exposeDockerSocket` option to *true*:

[source,yaml]
----
strategy:
  customStrategy:
    exposeDockerSocket: true
----

[NOTE]
====
Setting this value simply causes the build pod to attempt to mount `/var/run/docker.sock` from the
node host.  If your cluster's node hosts do not have a docker daemon, your builds will not be able
to leverage it.  In this case, consider using `buildah` to perform image build/push operations
instead.  See the <custom build tutorial> for an example of how this can be done.
