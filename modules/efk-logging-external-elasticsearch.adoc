= Configuring Fluentd to send logs to an external Elasticsearch instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`,
and `OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination,
and operations logs to `OPS_HOST`.

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
Fluentd Secure Forward to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

.Prerequisite

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

* Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state.

.Procedure

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance: 

. Edit the deployment configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:
+
----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_configuration>
----

. Set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value 
for an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs.

. Configure your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance for TLS:

** *If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance does not use TLS*, update the
`_CLIENT_CERT`, `_CLIENT_KEY`, and `_CA` variables to be empty. 

** *If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance uses TLS, but not mutual TLS*, 
update the `_CLIENT_CERT` and `_CLIENT_KEY` variables to be empty. Then patch or 
recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with the appropriate `_CA` value for 
communicating with your Elasticsearch instance.

** *If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance uses Mutual TLS*, patch 
or recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.
The provided Elasticsearch instance uses mutual TLS.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.
