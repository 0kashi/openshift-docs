In an _overcommited_ state, the sum of the container compute resource requests and limits exceeds the resources available on the system.
Overcommitment might be desirable in development environments where a trade-off of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.  

Requests and limits enable administrators to allow and manage the overcommitment of resources on a node. 
The scheduler uses requests for scheduling your container and providing a minimum service guarantee. 
Limits constrain the amount of compute resource that may be consumed on your node.
