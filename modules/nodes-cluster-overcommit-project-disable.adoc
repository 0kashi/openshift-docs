= Disabling overcommitment for a project

When configured, overcommitment can be disabled per-project.
For example, you can allow infrastructure components to be configured independently of overcommitment.

.Procedure

To disable overcommitment in a project:

. Edit the project object file

. Add the following annotation:
+
[source,bash]
----
quota.openshift.io/cluster-resource-override-enabled: "false"
----

. Create the project object:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc create -f <file-name>.yaml
----
