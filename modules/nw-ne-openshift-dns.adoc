= {product-title} DNS

If you are running multiple services, such as frontend and backend services for
use with multiple pods, environment variables are created for user names,
service IPs, and more so the frontend pods can communicate with the backend
services. If the service is deleted and recreated, a new IP address can be
assigned to the service, and requires the frontend pods to be recreated to pick
up the updated values for the service IP environment variable. Additionally, the
backend service has to be created before any of the frontend pods to ensure that
the service IP is generated properly, and that it can be provided to the
frontend pods as an environment variable.

For this reason, {product-title} has a built-in DNS so that the services can be
reached by the service DNS as well as the service IP/port. the client to
round-robin between each pod.
