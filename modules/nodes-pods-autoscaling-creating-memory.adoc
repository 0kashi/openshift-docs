= Creating a horizontal pod autoscaler object for memory utilization

[IMPORTANT]
====
Autoscaling for Memory Utilization is a Technology Preview feature only.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

.Prerequisites

In order to use horizontal pod autoscalers, your cluster administrator must have properly configured cluster metrics.

.Procedure

To create a horizontal pod autoscaler for memory utilization:

. Edit your cluster's `master-config.yaml` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
...
apiServerArguments:
  runtime-config:
  - apis/autoscaling/v2beta1=true
...
----

. Place the following in a file, such as `hpa.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: hpa-resource-metrics-memory <1>
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1 <2>
    kind: ReplicationController <3>
    name: hello-hpa-memory <4>
  minReplicas: 1 <5>
  maxReplicas: 10 <6>
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      targetAverageUtilization: 50 <7>
----
<1> The name of this horizontal pod autoscaler object
<2> The API version of the object to scale
<3> The kind of object to scale
<4> The name of the object to scale
<5> The minimum number of replicas to which to scale down
<6> The maximum number of replicas to which to scale up
<7> The average percentage of the requested memory that each pod should be using

. Create the autoscaler from the above file:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f hpa.yaml
----

. Restart the {product-title} services:
+
[source,bash]
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----
