= Using a pre-deployed image to improve efficiency

You can create a base {product-title} image with a number of tasks built-in to
improve efficiency, maintain configuration consistency on all node hosts, and
reduce repetitive tasks. This is known as a pre-deployed image. For example,
because every node requires the `ose-pod` image in order to run pods, each node
has to periodically connect to the container image registry in order to pull the
latest image. This can become problematic when you have 100 nodes attempting
this at the same time, and can lead to resource contention on the image
registry, waste of network bandwidth, and increased pod launch times.

.Procedure

To build a pre-deployed image:

. Create an instance of the type and size required.

. Ensure a dedicated storage device is available for CRI-O or local image
or container storage, separate from any persistent volumes for containers.

. Fully update the system, and ensure CRI-O or Docker is installed.

. Ensure the host has access to all yum repositories.

. Set up thin-provisioned LVM storage.

. Pre-pull your commonly used images (such as the rhel7 base image), as well as
{product-title} infrastructure container images (`ose-pod`, `ose-deployer`, and
so on) into your pre-deployed image.

. Ensure that pre-deployed images are configured for any appropriate cluster
configurations, such as being able to run on Red Hat OpenStack, or Amazon Web
Services (AWS), as well as any other cluster configurations.
