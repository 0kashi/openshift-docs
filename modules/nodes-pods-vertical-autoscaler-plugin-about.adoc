= About the VPA Admission Plugin

The {product-title} Vetical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) Admission Plugin sets the correct resource requests on new pods 
(either just created or recreated by their controller due to Updater's activity).

This is a binary that registers itself as a Mutating Admission Webhook and because of that is on the path of creating all pods. For each pod creation, it will get a request from the API server and it will either decide there's no matching VPA configuration or find the corresponding one and use current recommendation to set resource requests in the pod.
