Kubernetes ensures that Pods are able to network with each other, and allocates
each Pod an IP address from an internal network. This ensures all containers
within the Pod behave as if they were on the same host. Giving each Pod its own
IP address means that Pods can be treated like physical hosts or virtual
machines in terms of port allocation, networking, naming, service discovery,
load balancing, application configuration, and migration.

Creating links between Pods is unnecessary, and it is not recommended that your
Pods talk to one another directly using the IP address. Instead, it is recommend
that you create a service, then interact with the service.
