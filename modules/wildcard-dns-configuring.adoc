= Configuring a DNS wildcard

Optionally, configure a wildcard for the router to use, so that you do not need
to update your DNS configuration when new routes are added.

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
router.

.Procedure

* For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for `cloudapps` that has a low
time-to-live value (TTL) and points to the public IP address of the host where
the router will be deployed:
+
----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----
+
[WARNING]
====
In your *_/etc/resolv.conf_* file on each node host, ensure that the DNS server
that has the wildcard entry is not listed as a nameserver or that the wildcard
domain is not listed in the search list. Otherwise, containers managed by
{product-title} might fail to resolve host names properly.
