= About Event Router in {product-title}

The Event Router forwards {product-title} events for Cluster Logging.

In {product-title} all events are logged to `STDOUT`. The Event Router collects events and converts them into JSON format, where Fluentd and indexes the events to the `.operations` index when 
the Event Router is deployed into an operations namespace, such as `openshift-*`. You must manually deploy Event Router.
