= Custom build

The Custom build strategy allows developers to define a specific builder image
responsible for the entire build process. Using your own builder image allows
you to customize your build process.

A Custom builder image is a plain Docker-formatted container image embedded with
build process logic, for example for building RPMs or base images. The
`openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder` image is available on the
https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder[Docker
Hub] registry as an example implementation of a Custom builder image.
