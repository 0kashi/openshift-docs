= Installation options

In {product-title} version 4.0, you can install only clusters that use fully-managed
infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS). These clusters use Red Hat CoreOS
nodes as the operating system. Future versions of {product-title} will support
clusters that run on more cloud providers or using your own infrastructure.

////
If you want to
use any other cloud or install your cluster on-premise, use the bring your own
infrastructure option to install your cluster on existing Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux (RHEL) hosts.
////

The fully-managed option offers full-stack automation to:

* Manage compute
* Manage operating system (RHCOS)
* Manage control plane
* Manage nodes

////
With the bring your own infrastructure option, you have more responsibilities.
You must provide the hosts and update RHEL on them. {product-title} provides:

* Managed control plane
* Ansible to manage kubelet and container runtime
////

Installation and upgrade both use an Operator
that constantly reconciles component versions as if it were any other Kubernetes
controller.
