= Installing base packages

This module needs to be reworked or removed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to accept {product-title}'s
default `docker` configuration (using OverlayFS storage and all default logging
options), do not manually install these packages. These packages
are installed when you run the *_prerequisites.yml_* playbook during
installation.

If you want
to customize the `docker` configuration, install these packages.
====

.Procedure

. Install the following base packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils yum-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion kexec-tools sos psacct
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
# reboot
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Install the following package to obtain installer utilities and other packages that the
cluster installation process needs, such as Ansible, playbooks, and related
configuration files:
+
----
# yum install openshift-ansible
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Install additional {product-title} packages and requirements:

.. Install Ansible. To use EPEL as a package source for Ansible:

... Install the EPEL repository:
+
----
# yum -y install \
    https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
----

.. Disable the EPEL repository globally so that it is not accidentally used during
later steps of the installation:
+
----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

.. Install the packages for Ansible:
+
----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible pyOpenSSL
----

.. Clone the `openshift/openshift-ansible` repository from GitHub, which provides
the required playbooks and configuration files:
+
----
# cd ~
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
# cd openshift-ansible
# git checkout release-3.11
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to use the release branch of the `openshift-ansible` repository that
corresponds to your {product-title} version. Use the `master` branch to install
the version of {product-title} in development.
