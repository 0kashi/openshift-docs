= Disabling or enforcing CPU limits using CPU CFS quotas

Nodes by default enforce specified CPU limits using the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) quota support in
the Linux kernel. 

.Procedure

If you do not want to enforce CPU limits on the node, you can
disable its enforcement by modifying the appropriate node configuration map 
to include the following parameters:

[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  cpu-cfs-quota:
    - "false"
----

If CPU limit enforcement is disabled, it is important to understand the impact that will have on your node:

- If a container makes a request for CPU, it will continue to be enforced by CFS
shares in the Linux kernel.
- If a container makes no explicit request for CPU, but it does specify a limit,
the request will default to the specified limit, and be enforced by CFS shares
in the Linux kernel.
- If a container specifies both a request and a limit for CPU, the request will
be enforced by CFS shares in the Linux kernel, and the limit will have no
impact on the node.
