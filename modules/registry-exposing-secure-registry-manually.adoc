[id="registry-exposing-secure-registry-manually-{context}"]
= Exposing a secure registry manually

Instead of logging in to the {product-title} registry from within the
{product-title} cluster, you can gain external access to it by first securing
the registry and then exposing it with a route. This allows you to log in to the
registry from outside the cluster using the route address, and to tag and push
images using the route host.

.Prerequisites:

* The following prerequisites are automatically preformed:
** Deploy the registry.
** Secure the registry.
** Deploy a router.

.Procedure

. Verify whether a passthrough route exists, the route should have been created by
default for the registry during the initial cluster installation:
+
----
$ oc get route/pod-registry -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: podman-registry
spec:
  host: <host> <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: podman-registry <2>
  tls:
    termination: passthrough <3>
----
<1> The host for your route. You must be able to resolve this name externally by
DNS to the router's IP address.
<2> The service name for your registry.
<3> Specifies this route as a passthrough route.
+
[NOTE]
====
Re-encrypt routes are also supported for exposing the secure registry.
====

.. If it does not exist, create the route with the `oc create route passthrough`
command, specifying the registry as the routeâ€™s service. By default, the name of
the created route is the same as the service name:

... Get the *podman-registry* service details:
+
----
$ oc get svc
NAME              CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                 SELECTOR                  AGE
podman-registry   172.30.69.167    <none>        5000/TCP                podman-registry=default   4h
kubernetes        172.30.0.1       <none>        443/TCP,53/UDP,53/TCP   <none>                    4h
router            172.30.172.132   <none>        80/TCP                  router=router             4h
----

... Create the route:
+
----
$ oc create route passthrough    \
    --service=podman-registry    \//<1>
    --hostname=<host>
route "podman-registry" created     <2>
----
<1> Specifies the registry as the route's service.
<2> The route name is identical to the service name.

. Trust the certificates being used for the registry on your host
system to allow the host to push and pull images. The certificates referenced
were created when you secured your registry:
+
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/podman/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo cp <ca_certificate_file> /etc/podman/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo systemctl restart podman
----

. Log in to the registry using the information from securing the registry.
However, this time point to the host name used in the route rather than your
service IP. When logging in to a secured and exposed registry, make sure you
specify the registry in the `podman login` command:
+
----
# podman login -e user@company.com \
    -u f83j5h6 \
    -p Ju1PeM47R0B92Lk3AZp-bWJSck2F7aGCiZ66aFGZrs2 \
    <host>
----

. You can now tag and push images using the route host. For example, to tag and
push a `busybox` image in a project called `test`:
+
----
$ oc get imagestreams -n test
NAME      PODMAN REPO   TAGS      UPDATED

$ podman pull busybox
$ podman tag busybox <host>/test/busybox
$ podman push <host>/test/busybox
The push refers to a repository [<host>/test/busybox] (len: 1)

====
Your image streams will have the IP address and port of the registry service,
not the route name and port. See `oc get imagestreams` for details.
