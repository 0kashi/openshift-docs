= Persistent storage requirements for BYO installations

The Kubernetes persistent volume framework allows you to provision an {product-title} cluster with persistent storage
using networked storage available in your environment. This can be done after
completing the initial {product-title} installation depending on your application
needs, giving users a way to request those resources without having any
knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

The Configuring Clusters guide provides instructions for cluster administrators
on provisioning an {product-title} cluster with persistent storage using:

* NFS
* GlusterFS
* Ceph RBD
* OpenStack Cinder
* AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* GCE Persistent Disks
* iSCSI.
