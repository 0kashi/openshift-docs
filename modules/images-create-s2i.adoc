= Creating images from source code with s2i
Source-to-Image
(S2I) is a framework that makes it easy to write images that take application
source code as an input and produce a new image that runs the assembled
application as output.

The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible container images is the
ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must understand two
basic concepts in order for your images to provide the best possible S2I performance:
the build process and S2I scripts.
