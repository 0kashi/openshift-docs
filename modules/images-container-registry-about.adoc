= Container registry

A *container registry* is a content server that can store and service
container images. For example:

----
registry.access.redhat.com
----

A registry contains a collection of one or more image repositories, which
contain one or more tagged images. Red Hat provides a registry at
`registry.redhat.io` for subscribers. {product-title} can also supply its own
internal registry for managing custom container images. For example, the
OpenShift Jenkins images are in the Red Hat registry under the following
repository name:

----
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7
----
