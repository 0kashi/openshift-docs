= Creating ServiceMonitor resources

Operator authors can add Service target discovery of created monitoring Services
using the `metrics.CreateServiceMonitor()` helper function, which accepts the
newly created Service.

.Prerequisites

- Go-based Operator generated using the Operator SDK
- Kubernetes-based cluster with the Prometheus Operator deployed

.Procedure

. Add the `metrics.CreateServiceMonitor()` helper function to your Operator code,
creating only one ServiceMonitor per application and namespace:
+
[source,go]
----
    import "github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/pkg/metrics"

    serviceMonitors, err := metrics.CreateServiceMonitors(config *rest.Config, ns string, services []*v1.Service) <1>
    if err != nil {
        <2>
    }
----
<1> Pass the Service(s) to the helper function, which in turn returns the ServiceMonitor object.
<2> Handle errors here.
