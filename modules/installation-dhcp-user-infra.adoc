= Networking requirements for user-provisioned infrastructure

All the {op-system-first} machines require network in `initramfs` during boot
to fetch Ignition config from the Machine Config Server.

During the initial boot, the machines require a DHCP server in order to
establish a network connection to download their Ignition config files.

It is recommended to use the DHCP server to manage the machines for the cluster
long-term. Ensure that the DHCP server is configured to provide persistent IP
addresses and host names to the cluster machines.

//After the initial boot, the machines can be configured to use static IP addresses.
