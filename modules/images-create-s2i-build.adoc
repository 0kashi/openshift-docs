= Understanding the s2i build process
The build process consists of the following three fundamental elements, which
are combined into a final container image:

- sources
- S2I scripts
- builder image

During the build process, S2I must place sources and scripts inside the builder
image. To do so, S2I creates a *_tar_* file that contains the sources and
scripts, then streams that file into the builder image. Before executing the
*_assemble_* script, S2I untars that file and places its contents into the
location specified by the `*io.openshift.s2i.destination*`
label from the builder image, with the default location being the
*_/tmp_* directory.

For this process to happen, your image must supply the *tar* archiving
utility (the `tar` command available in `*$PATH*`) and the command line
interpreter (the `/bin/sh` command); this allows your image to use the fastest
possible build path. If the `tar` or `/bin/sh` command is not available, the
`s2i build` process is forced to automatically perform an additional container build
to put both the sources and the scripts inside the image, and only then run the
usual build.

See the following diagram for the basic S2I build workflow:

Run build's responsibility is to untar the sources, scripts and artifacts
(if such exist) and invoke the `assemble` script.  If this is the second run
(after catching `tar` or `/bin/sh` not found error) it is responsible only
for invoking `assemble` script, since both scripts and sources are already there.
