= Moving the monitoring solution

[IMPORTANT]
====
The monitoring solution uses Cluster Version Operator (CVO) to create the
ConfigMap that the monitoring Operator uses to determine how to deploy its
resources. Because it uses the CVO and users cannot modify the CVO, you cannot
change where the Operator deploys resources.
