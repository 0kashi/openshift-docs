= Accessing registry directly

You can access the registry directly to invoke `docker` commands. This allows
you to push images to or pull them from the integrated registry directly using
operations like `docker push` or `docker pull`. To do so, you must be logged in
to the registry using the `docker login` command. The operations you can perform
depend on your user permissions, as described in the following sections.

.Prerequisites

* For any direct access, you must have a regular user for your preferred identity
provider.
** A regular user can generate an access token required for logging in to
the registry.
** System users, such as *system:admin*, cannot obtain access tokens
and, therefore, cannot access the registry directly.
+
For example, if you are using `HTPASSWD` authentication, you can create one
using the following command:
+
----
# htpasswd /etc/origin/openshift-htpasswd <user_name>
----

* For pulling images, for example when using the `docker pull` command,
the user must have the *registry-viewer* role. To add this role:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-viewer <user_name>
----

* For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `docker push` command,
the user must have the *registry-editor* role. To add this role:
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor <user_name>
----

.Procedure

. Log in to the registry directly:

.. Ensure you are logged in to {product-title} as a *regular user*:
+
----
$ oc login
----

.. Log in to the container image registry by using your access token:
+
----
docker login -u openshift -p $(oc whoami -t) <registry_ip>:<port>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can pass any value for the username, the token contains all necessary
information. Passing a username that contains colons will result in a login
failure.
====
+
. Perform `docker pull` and `docker push` operations against your registry:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can pull arbitrary images, but if you have the *system:registry* role
added, you can only push images to the registry in your project.
====
+
In the following examples, we use:
+
|====
|Component |Value

|*<registry_ip>*
|`172.30.124.220`

|*<port>*
|`5000`

|*<project>*
|`openshift`

|*<image>*
|`busybox`

|*<tag>*
| omitted (defaults to `latest`)
|====

.. Pull an arbitrary image:
+
----
$ docker pull docker.io/busybox
----

.. Tag the new image with the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`.
The project name *must* appear in this pull specification for {product-title} to
correctly place and later access the image in the registry:
+
----
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Your regular user must have the *system:image-builder* role for the specified
project, which allows the user to write or push an image. Otherwise, the `docker
push` in the next step will fail. To test, you can create a new project to
push the *busybox* image.
====

.. Push the newly-tagged image to your registry:
+
----
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
...
cf2616975b4a: Image successfully pushed
