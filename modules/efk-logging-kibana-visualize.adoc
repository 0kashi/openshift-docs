= Configuring Kibana Visualize

Kibana Visualize enables you to create visualizations and dashboards for
monitoring container and pod logs allows administrator users (`cluster-admin` or
`cluster-reader`) to view logs by deployment, namespace, pod, and container.

Kibana Visualize exists inside the Elasticsearch and ES-OPS
pod, and must be run inside those pods. To load dashboards and other Kibana UI
objects, you must first log into Kibana as the user you want to add the
dashboards to, then log out. This will create the necessary per-user
configuration that the next step relies on. Then, run:

----
$ oc exec <$espod> -- es_load_kibana_ui_objects <user-name>
----

Where `$espod` is the name of any one of your Elasticsearch pods.
