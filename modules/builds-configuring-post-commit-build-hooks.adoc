= Configuring post commit build hooks

There are different ways to configure the post build hook. All forms in the
following examples are equivalent and execute `bundle exec rake test --verbose`.

.Procedure

* Shell script:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  script: "bundle exec rake test --verbose"
----
+
The `script` value is a shell script to be run with `/bin/sh -ic`. Use
this when a shell script is appropriate to execute the build hook. For example,
for running unit tests as above. To control the image entry point,
or if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, use `command` and/or `args`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The additional `-i` flag was introduced to improve the experience
working with CentOS and RHEL images, and may be removed in a future release.
====

* Command as the image entry point:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "bundle exec rake test --verbose"]
----
+
In this form, `command` is the command to run, which overrides the image
entry point in the exec form, as documented in the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint[Dockerfile reference]. This is needed if the image does not have `/bin/sh`, or if
you do not want to use a shell. In all other cases, using `script` might be
more convenient.

* Pass arguments to the default entry point:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  args: ["bundle", "exec", "rake", "test", "--verbose"]
----
+
In this form, `args` is a list of arguments that are provided to the default
entry point of the image. The image entry point must be able to handle
arguments.

* Shell script with arguments:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  script: "bundle exec rake test $1"
  args: ["--verbose"]
----
+
Use this form if you need to pass arguments that would otherwise be hard
to quote properly in the shell script. In the `script`, `$0` will be "/bin/sh"
and `$1`, `$2`, etc, are the positional arguments from `args`.

* Command with arguments:
+
[source,yaml]
----
postCommit:
  command: ["bundle", "exec", "rake", "test"]
  args: ["--verbose"]
----
+
This form is equivalent to appending the arguments to `command`.

[NOTE]
====
Providing both `script` and `command` simultaneously creates an invalid
build hook.
