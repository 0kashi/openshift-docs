= Viewing memory and CPU usage statistics on your nodes

You can display usage statistics about nodes, which provide the runtime
environments for containers. These usage statistics include CPU, memory, and
storage consumption.

.Prerequisites

* You must have `cluster-reader` permission to view the usage statistics.

* Metrics must be installed to view the usage statistics.

.Procedure

* To view the usage statistics:
+
----
$ oc adm top nodes
NAME       CPU(cores)   CPU%      MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
node-1     297m         29%       4263Mi          55%
node-0     55m          5%        1201Mi          15%
infra-1    85m          8%        1319Mi          17%
infra-0    182m         18%       2524Mi          32%
master-0   178m         8%        2584Mi          16%
----

* To view the usage statistics for nodes with labels:
+
----
$ oc adm top node --selector=''
----
+
You must choose the selector (label query) to filter on. Supports `=`, `==`, and `!=`.
