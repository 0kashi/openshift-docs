= Squash layers with docker builds

Docker builds normally create a layer representing each instruction in a 
*_Dockerfile_*. Setting the `imageOptimizationPolicy` to `SkipLayers` will merge 
all instructions into a single layer on top of the base image.

.Procedure

To set the `imageOptimizationPolicy` to `SkipLayers`:
[source, yaml]
----
strategy:
  dockerStrategy:
    imageOptimizationPolicy: SkipLayers <1>
----
<1> Layers are always squashed in OpenShift 4.0 at present, but this is subject to change 
in a future release.
