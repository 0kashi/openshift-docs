Telemetry collects anonymized aggregated information about:

* The size of an {product-title} cluster
* The health and status of {product-title} components
* Use of {product-title} components
* The features in use

This information is used by Red Hat to help make {product-title} better and more intuitive to use. None of the information is shared with third parties.
