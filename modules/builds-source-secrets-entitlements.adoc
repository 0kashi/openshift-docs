= Adding entitlements as a build secret

Builds which use entitlements to install subscription content must include the 
entitlement keys as a build secret.

.Prerequisites

You must have access to Red Hat entitlements, and the entitlement must have 
separate public and private key files.

.Procedure

. Create a secret containing your entitlements, ensuring that there are separate 
files containing the entitlement public and private keys:
+
[source, bash]
----
$  oc create secret generic etc-pki-entitlement --from-file /path/to/entitlement/{ID}.pem \
> --from-file /path/to/entitlement/{ID}-key.pem ...
----
+

. Add the secret as a build input in the build configuration:
+
[source, yaml]
----
source:
  secrets:
  - secret:
      name: etc-pki-entitlement
    destinationDir: etc-pki-entitlement
----
+
