= Integrated {product-title} registry

{product-title} provides an integrated container image registry called
_{product-title} Container Registry_ (OCR) that adds the ability to automatically
provision new image repositories on demand. This provides users with a built-in
location for their application builds to push the resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to OCR, the registry notifies {product-title}
about the new image, passing along all the information about it, such as the
namespace, name, and image metadata. Different pieces of {product-title} react
to new images, creating new builds and deployments.

OCR can also be deployed as a stand-alone component that acts solely as a
container image registry, without the build and deployment integration.

//See installing a stand-alone deployment of {product-title} Container Registry
for details.
