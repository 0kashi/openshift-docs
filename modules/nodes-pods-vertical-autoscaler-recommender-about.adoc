= About the Recommender

The {product-title} Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) Recommender computes the recommended resource requests for pods based on historical and current usage of the resources. 

The Recommender provides one means of having resource limits that more closely match the actual needs of a pod. With more accurate limits, a node can be better utilized by not having excess capacity reserved for a pod that does not need it.

You can configure the Recommender to automatically change your CPU and memory requests.
