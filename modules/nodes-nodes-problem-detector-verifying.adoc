= Verifying that the Node Problem Detector is Running

You can use the steps in this section to verify that the Node Problem Detector is running and generate typical problems to ensure that the Node problem Detector responds properly.

.Prerequisite

The Problem Node Detector is installed in your {product-title} cluster. The Node Problem Detector is installed by default or manually.

.Procedure

To verify that the Node Problem Detector is active:

. Run the following command to get the name of the Problem Node Detector pod:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-node-problem-detector

NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
node-problem-detector-8z8r8   1/1       Running   0          1h
node-problem-detector-nggjv   1/1       Running   0          1h

----

. Run the following command to view log information on the Problem Node Detector pod:
+
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-node-problem-detector <pod_name>
----
+
The output should be similar to the following:
+
----
$ oc logs -n openshift-node-problem-detector node-problem-detector-c6kng
I0416 23:22:00.641354       1 log_monitor.go:63] Finish parsing log monitor config file: {WatcherConfig:{Plugin:journald PluginConfig:map[source:kernel] LogPath:/host/log/journal Lookback:5m} BufferSize:10 Source:kernel-monitor DefaultConditions:[{Type:KernelDeadlock Status:false Transition:0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC Reason:KernelHasNoDeadlock Message:kernel has no deadlock}]
----

. Test the Node Problem Detector by simulating an event on the node:
+
----
$ echo "kernel: divide error: 0000 [#0] SMP." >> /dev/kmsg
----

. Test the Node Problem Detector by simulating a condition on the node:
+
----
$ echo "kernel: task blocked for more than 300 seconds." >> /dev/kmsg
----
