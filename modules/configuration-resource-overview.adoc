= About Configuration Resources in {product-title}

You perform many customization and configuration tasks after you deploy your
cluster, including configuring networking and setting your identity provider.

In {product-title}, you modify Configuration Resources to determine the behavior
of these integrations. The Configuration Resources are controlled by Operators
that are managed by the Cluster Version Operator, which manages all of the
Operators that run your cluster's control plane.

You can customize the following Configuration Resources:

[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Configuration Resource |Description
|Authentication
|

|DNS
|

|Image
|

|Infrastructure
|

|Ingress
|

|Network
|

|OAuth
|

|===

While you can complete many other customizations and configure other integrations
with a {product-title} cluster, configuring these resources is a common first
step after you deploy a cluster.

Like all Operators, the Configuration Resources are governed by
Custom Resource Definitions (CRD). You customize the CRD for each
Configuration Resource that you want to modify in your cluster.
