= About the {product-title} update service and Cluster Version Operator

The {product-title} update service is the hosted service that provides over-the-air
updates to both {product-title} and {op-system-first}. It provides a graph,
or diagram that contain _vertices_ and the _edges_ that connect them, of
component Operators. The edges in the graph show which versions you can safely
update to, and the vertices are update payloads that specify the intended state
of the managed cluster components.

The Cluster Version Operator (CVO) in your cluster checks with the
{product-title} update service to see the valid updates and update paths based
on current component versions and information in the graph. When you request an
update, the {product-title} CVO uses the release image for that update to
upgrade your cluster. The release artifacts are hosted in Quay as container
images.

To allow the {product-title} update service to provide only compatible updates,
a release verification pipeline exists to drive automation. Each release
artifact is verified for compatibility with supported cloud platforms and system
architectures as well as other component packages. After the pipeline confirms
the suitability of a release, the {product-title} update service can apply the
update to your cluster or notify you that it is available.

During continuous update mode, two controllers run. One continuously updates
the payload manifests, applies them to the cluster, and outputs the status of
the controlled rollout of the Operators, whether they are available, upgrading,
or failed. The second controller polls the {product-title} update service to
determine if updates are available.
