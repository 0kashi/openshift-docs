[id='block-volume-support-{context}']
= Block volume support

You can statically provision raw block volumes by including API fields
in your PV and PVC specifications. This functionality is only available for
manually provisioned PVs.

To use a block volume, you must first enable the `BlockVolume` feature 
gate. To enable the feature gates for master(s), add `feature-gates` to
`apiServerArguments` and `controllerArguments`. To enable the feature 
gates for node(s), add `feature-gates` to `kubeletArguments`. For example:

----
kubeletArguments:
   feature-gates:
     - BlockVolume=true
----
