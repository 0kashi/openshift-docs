= Creating {op-system-first} machines in vSphere

Before you install a user provisioned infrastructure (UPI) cluster on vSphere,
you need to create {op-system} machines on a single host for it to use.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the Ignition config files for your cluster.
* Have access to an HTTP server that you can access from your computer and that
the machines that you create can access.

.Procedure

////
This will work for GA.
. Obtain the {op-system} images from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads[Product Downloads] page on the Red
Hat customer portal.
////

. Convert the bootstrap, master, and worker Ignition config files to Base64
encoding.

. Upload the Base64-encoded bootstrap Ignition config file that the
installation program created to your HTTP server. Note the URLs of this file.
+
You must host the bootstrap Ignition config file because it is too large to
fit in a vApp property.

. Save a secondary Ignition config file for your bootstrap node to your computer.

{
  "ignition": {
    "config": {
      "append": [
        {
          "source": "<bootstrap_ignition_config_url>", <1>
          "verification": {}
        }
      ]
    },
    "timeouts": {},
    "version": "2.1.0"
  },
  "networkd": {},
  "passwd": {},
  "storage": {},
  "systemd": {}
}
----
<1> Specify the URL of the bootstrap Ignition config file that you hosted.
+
When you create the Virtual Machine (VM) for the bootstrap machine, you reference
this Ignition config file.

. Convert the temporary bootstrap file to Base64 encoding.

. Obtain the {op-system} OVA image:
+
----
$ curl -J -L -O https://releases-art-rhcos.svc.ci.openshift.org/art/storage/releases/ootpa/410.8.20190412.1/rhcos-410.8.20190412.1-vmware.ova
----

. In the vSphere Client, create a folder in your datacenter to store your VMs.
The folder name must match the cluster name that you specified in the
`install-config.yaml` file.

. In the vSphere Client, create a template for the OVA image.
+
[NOTE]
====
In the following steps, you use the same template for all of your cluster
machines and provide the location for the Ignition config file for that machine
type when you provision the VMs.
====
.. From the *Hosts and Clusters* tab, right-click your cluster's name and
click *Deploy OVF Template*.
.. On the *Select an OVF* tab, specify the name of the {op-system} OVA file
that you downloaded.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, set a *Virtual machine name*, such
as {op-system}, and click the name of the your vSphere cluster.
.. On the *Select a compute resource* tab, click the name of the your vSphere
cluster.
.. On the *Select storage* tab, configure the storage options for your VM.
*** Select *Thin Provision*.
*** Select the datastore that you specified in your `install-config.yaml` file.
.. On the *Select network* tab, specify the the network that you configured
for the cluster, if available.
.. If you plan to use the same template for all cluster machine types, do not
specify values on the *Customize template* tab.

. After the template deploys, deploy a VM for a machine in the cluster.
.. Right-click the template's name and click *Clone* -> *Clone to Virtual Machine*.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, specify a name for the VM. You might
include the machine type in the name, such as `control-plane-0` or `compute-1`.
.. On the *Select a name and folder* tab, select the name of the folder that
you created for the cluster.
.. On the *Select a compute resource* tab, select the name of a host in your
datacenter.
.. Optionally, on the *Select storage* tab, customize the storage options.
.. On the *Select clone options*, select
*Customize this virtual machine's hardware*.
.. On the *Customize hardware* tab, click *VM Options* -> *Advanced*.
*** From the *Latency Sensitivity* list, select *High*.
*** Click *Edit Configuration*, and on the *Configuration Parameters* window,
click *Add Configuration Params*. Define the following parameter names and values:
**** `guestinfo.ignition.config.data`: Paste the contents of the base64-encoded
Ignition config file for this machine type.
**** `guestinfo.ignition.config.data.encoding`: Specify `base64`.
**** `enable_disk_uuid`: Specify `true`.
.. In the *Virtual Hardware* panel of the
*Customize hardware* tab, modify the specified values as required. Ensure that
the amount of RAM, CPU, and disk storage meets the minimum requirements for the
machine type.
.. Complete the configuration and power on the VM.

. Create the rest of the machines for your cluster by following the preceding
steps for each machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must create the boostrap and control plane machines at this time. To simplify
machine management after installation, also create some compute machines.
