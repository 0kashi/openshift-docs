= Viewing Fluentd logs

How you view logs depends upon the `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` setting.

* If `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` points to a file, use the *logs* utility to print out the contents of Fluentd log files:
+
----
oc exec <pod> logs <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of the Fluentd pod.
+
For example:
+
----
oc exec logging-fluentd-lmvms logs
----
+
The contents of log files are printed out, starting with the oldest log.  Use `-f` option to follow what is being written into the logs.

* If you are using `LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console`, fluentd to write logs to STDOUT. You can retrieve the logs with the `oc logs -f <pod_name>` command.
+
For example
+
----
oc logs -f /var/log/fluentd/fluentd.log
----
