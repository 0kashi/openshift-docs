= Configuring quota synchronization period

When a set of resources are deleted, but before quota usage is restored, a user
might encounter problems when attempting to reuse the resources. The
synchronization time frame of resources is determined by the
`resource-quota-sync-period` setting, which can be configured by a cluster
administrator.

Adjusting the regeneration time can be helpful for creating resources and
determining resource usage when automation is used.

[NOTE]
====
The `resource-quota-sync-period` setting is designed to balance system
performance. Reducing the sync period can result in a heavy load on the master.

.Procedure

To configure the quota synchronization period:

. Change the `resource-quota-sync-period` setting to have the set of resources
regenerate at the desired amount of time (in seconds) and for the resources to
be available again:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiLevels:
  - v1beta3
  - v1
  apiServerArguments: null
  controllerArguments:
    resource-quota-sync-period:
      - "10s"
----

. Restart the master services to apply the changes:
+
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
