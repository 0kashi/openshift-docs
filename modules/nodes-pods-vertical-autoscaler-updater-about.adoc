= About the VPA Updater

The {product-title} Vetical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) Updater checks which of the managed pods have correct resources set and, if not, 
kills them so that they can be recreated by their controllers with the updated requests.

Updater runs in Kubernetes cluster and decides which pods should be restarted based on resources allocation recommendation calculated by Recommender. If a pod should be updated, Updater will try to evict the pod. It respects the pod disruption budget, by using Eviction API to evict pods. Updater does not perform the actual resources update, but relies on Vertical Pod Autoscaler admission plugin to update pod resources when the pod is recreated after eviction.
