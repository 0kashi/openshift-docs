= About the custom installation

The custom installation is divided into four phases:

* Initialization, where you create and customize the installation configuration
file 
* Rendering, where you provide YAML files that describe further customizations
* Preparing, where the system creates assets based on the rendered data
* Launching, where you create the cluster in your cloud.

During initialization, you generate and customize a cluster configuration file that
defines high level configuration and topology and specifies your cloud provider
credentials. This configuration file contains a limited set of parameters that
most clusters require.

During rendering, you do a thing with a bunch of yaml files that allows you to
provide more customization to your cluster. You can specify ...

During the preparing phase, the assets that you render...

Finally, you launch the installation. The installer first creates the
infrastructure for the cluster, such as the load balancers, security groups, and
VPCs, and then creates an initial configuration on a bootstrap master node.
The bootstrap master then completes the configuration of the cluster by 
self-configuring and loading other components. By default, all the cluster nodes
run Red Hat CoreOS as the operating system.

After the installation and configuration process is complete, instructions for 
connecting to the cluster displays.
