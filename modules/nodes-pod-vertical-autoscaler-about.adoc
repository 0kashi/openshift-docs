= About the Vertical Pod Autoscaler

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler automatically computes the CPU and memory resource usage for pods based on historical and current usage of the resources and sets the requests on Pods automatically based on this usage, ensuring appropriate resources are available for each Pod. 

The VPA scales down Pods that request more resources then they are using and scale up Pods that are not requesting enough.

For example, VPA helps developers ensure their Pods stay up during periods of high demand. If the resource requirements for a pod increase, VPA automatically increases 
the pod resources to match its need. If the Pod does not have the required capability, the Pod might be terminated. 

Administrators, can use VPA to better utilize cluster resources, such as preventing Pods from reserve more CPU resources than needed. The VPA monitors the resources that
workloads are actually using and adjusts the resource requirements so capacity is available to other workloads.

The Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator consists of three components:

* *Recommender*. The Recommender monitors the current and past resource consumption and provides recommended values for container CPU and memory requests.

* *Updater*. The Updater ensures that containers are using the recommended resources. If not, the Updater kills the pods, which will restart with the updated resources.
You can use pod disruption budgets to ensure pods are always up.

* *Admission Plugin*. The Admission Plugin restarts the killed pods with the updated requests.

You can use the VPA Custom Resource object, called `VerticalPodAutoscaler`, to specify which Pods to scaled  and how the resource recommendations are applied.
