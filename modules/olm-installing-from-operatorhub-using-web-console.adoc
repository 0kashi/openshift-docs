= Installing from the OperatorHub using the web console

This procedure uses the Couchbase Operator as an example to install and subscribe to
an Operator from the OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin`
permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Catalog → OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box (in this case,
`Couchbase`) to find the Operator you want.

. Select the Operator. For a Community Operator, you are warned that Red Hat
does not certify those Operators. You must acknowledge that warning before
continuing. Information about the Operator is displayed.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select:
.. *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to install the Operator to all
namespaces or *A specific namespace on the cluster* to choose a specific, single
namespace on which to install the Operator. The *All namespaces...* option is
not always available.
.. An *Update Channel* (if more than one is available).
.. *Automatic* or *Manual* approval strategy, as described earlier.

. Click *Subscribe* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on
this {product-title} cluster.

. From the *Catalog → Operator Management* page, you can monitor an Operator
Subscription's installation and upgrade progress.

.. If you selected a Manual approval strategy, the Subscription's upgrade status
will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its Install Plan.

After approving on the *Install Plan* page, the Subscription upgrade status
moves to *Up to date*.

.. If you selected an Automatic approval strategy, the upgrade status should
resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.

. After the Subscription's upgrade status is *Up to date*, select *Catalog →
Installed Operators* to verify that the *Couchbase* ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)
eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately resolves to either *Copied* (for
*All namespaces...* Installation Mode) or *InstallSucceeded* (for *A specific namespace...*
Installation Mode).
+
If it does not:

.. Switch to the *Catalog → Operator Management* page and inspect
the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*.

.. Check the logs in any Pods in the *openshift-operators* project (or other
relevant namespace if *A specific namespace...* Installation Mode was selected)
on the *Workloads → Pods* page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot
further.
