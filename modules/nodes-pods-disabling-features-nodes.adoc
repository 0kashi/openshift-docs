= Disabling features for a node

You can turn off a feature for a specific node type in the cluster.

.Procedure

To turn off a feature a node type: 

. Edit the appropriate node configuration map:

. For the feature you want to turn off, enter: `<feature_name>=false` under`proxyArguments`.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
proxyArguments:
  feature-gates:
  - HugePages=false
----

. Restart the {product-title} service for the changes to take effect:
+
[source,bash]
----
# master-restart controllers
----

To re-enable a disabled feature, edit the node configuration file to remove the `<feature_name>=false`
and restart the master and node services.
