= Installing from the OperatorHub using the web console

This procedure uses the etcd Operator as an example to install and subscribe to
an Operator from the OperatorHub using the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with `cluster-admin`
permissions.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Catalog → Operator Hub* page.

. Click *Show Community Operators*.
+
[NOTE]
====
This Operator will be available under the *Red Hat* category in the GA release.
====

. Choose *etcd* from the list of available Operators, and click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, change the *Target* to the
*global-operators* Operator Group. This makes the Operator available to all
users and projects that use this {product-title} cluster.

. On the *Catalog → Installed Operators* page, verify that the *etcd*
ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately
resolves to *InstallSucceeded*.
+
If it does not, switch to the *Catalog → Operator Management* page and inspect
the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors
under *Status*. Then, check the logs in any Pods in the *openshift-operators*
project (on the *Workloads → Pods* page) that are reporting issues to
troubleshoot further.
