= DNS Operator

OpenShift's DNS Operator manages a DNS Service on the cluster, and configures
`kubelets` to tell individual containers to use the DNS Serviceâ€™s IP to resolve
DNS names.

The DNS Operator is deployed during installation and creates a working default
deployment based on the cluster's configuration.

The default cluster domain is `cluster.local`, and the default Service IP used
for DNS is `.10` from the service CIDR. For example:

* To find the service CIDR:
+
----
$ oc get networks.config/cluster -o jsonpath='{$.status.serviceNetwork}'
[172.30.0.0/16]
----

* To find the service IP used for DNS:
+
----
$ oc get service/dns-default -n openshift-dns -o jsonpath='{$.spec.clusterIP}'
172.30.0.10
----
