= Exposing a non-secure registry manually

Instead of securing the registry in order to expose the registry, you can simply
expose a non-secure registry for non-production {product-title} environments.
This allows you to have an external route to the registry without using SSL
certificates.

[WARNING]
====
Only non-production environments should expose a non-secure registry to external access.
====

.Procedure

To expose a non-secure registry:

. Expose the registry:
+
----
# oc expose service podman-registry --hostname=<hostname> -n default
----
+
This creates the following JSON file:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    podman-registry: default
  name: podman-registry
spec:
  host: registry.example.com
  port:
    targetPort: "5000"
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: podman-registry
status: {}
----
. Verify that the route has been created successfully:
+
----
# oc get route
NAME              HOST/PORT                    PATH      SERVICE           LABELS                    INSECURE POLICY   TLS TERMINATION
podman-registry   registry.example.com            podman-registry   podman-registry=default
----
. Check the health of the registry:
+
----
$ curl -v http://registry.example.com/healthz
----
+
Expect an HTTP 200/OK message.
+
After exposing the registry, update your *_/etc/sysconfig/podman_* file by
adding the port number to the `OPTIONS` entry. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry=172.30.0.0/16 --insecure-registry registry.example.com:80'
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The options in the previous example should be added on the client from which you
are trying to log in.

Also, ensure that Podman is running on the client.
====

When logging in to the non-secured and exposed registry, make sure you specify the registry
in the `podman login` command. For example:

----
# podman login -e user@company.com \
    -u f83j5h6 \
    -p Ju1PeM47R0B92Lk3AZp-bWJSck2F7aGCiZ66aFGZrs2 \
    <host>
----
