= About the template service broker

The _template service broker_ gives the service catalog visibility into the
default Instant App and Quickstart templates that have shipped with
{product-title} since its initial release. The template service broker can also
make available as a service anything for which an {product-title} template has
been written, whether provided by Red Hat, a cluster administrator or user, or a
third party vendor.

By default, the template service broker shows the objects that are globally
available from the `openshift` project. It can also be configured to watch any
other project that a cluster administrator chooses.

The template service broker is not installed by default in {product-title} 4.
