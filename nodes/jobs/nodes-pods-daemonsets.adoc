As an administrator, you can create and use DaemonSets to run replicas of a pod on specific or all nodes in an {product-title} cluster.

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to the cluster. 
As nodes are removed from the cluster, those pods are removed through garbage collection. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

You can use daemonsets to create shared storage, run a logging pod on every node in
your cluster, or deploy a monitoring agent on every node.

For security reasons, only cluster administrators can create daemonsets.

For more information on daemonsets, see the link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/daemons/[Kubernetes documentation].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Daemonset scheduling is incompatible with project's default node selector.
If you fail to disable it, the daemonset gets restricted by merging with the
default node selector. This results in frequent pod recreates on the nodes that
got unselected by the merged node selector, which in turn puts unwanted load on
the cluster.
