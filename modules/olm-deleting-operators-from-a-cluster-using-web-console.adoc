= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console

To delete an installed Operator from the selected namespace through the Web console, follow these steps:

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Catalog* â†’ *Operator Management* page.
. Click the *Operator Subscriptions* tab to see the list of installed Operators
for the namespace.
. Find the Operator you want to delete (in this example, jaeger) and click
the three-dot drop-down box in far right column.

. Click *Remove Subscription*.
. When prompted from the *Remove Subscription* pop-up, optionally select the
`Also completely remove the jaeger Operator from the selected namespace`
checkbox, if you want all components related to the installation to be removed.
This removes the CSV, which in turn removes the pods, the deployments, the
CRDs, and CRs associated with the Operator.
. Select *Remove*. This Operator will stop running and no longer receive updates.

[NOTE]
====
Although the Operator is no longer installed or receiving updates, that
Operator will still appear on the Operator Catalogs list, ready to re-subscribe. To remove the Operator from that
listing, you can delete the Operator's entry in the CatalogSourceConfig
from the command line (as shown in last step of "Deleting operators from a cluster using the CLI").
