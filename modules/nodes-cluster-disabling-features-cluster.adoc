= Enabling Technical Preview features using feature gates

You can turn Technical Preview features on and off for all nodes in the cluster
by editing the Feature Gates Custom Resource, named *cluster*, in the
*openshift-config* project.

[NOTE]
====
Turning on Technical Preview features cannot be undone and prevents upgrades.
====

The following features are affected by Feature Gates.

[options="header"]
|===
| Feature gate| Description

| *CSIBlockVolume*
| Enables external CSI drivers to implement raw block volume support.

| *ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation*
| Enables annotating specific pods as critical so that their scheduling is guaranteed.

| *MachineHealthCheck*
| Enables automatically repairing damaged machines in a machine pool

| *RotateKubeletServerCertificate*
| Enables the rotation of the server TLS certificate on the cluster.

| *SupportPodPidsLimit*
| Enables support for limiting the number of processes (PIDs) running in a pod.

.Procedure

To turn on the Technical Preview features for the entire cluster:

//The steps to create the instance are for Beta only

. Create the Feature Gates instance:

.. Switch to the the *Administration* -> *Custom Resource Definitions* page.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click *FeatureGate*.

.. On the *Custom Resource Definitions* page, click the *Actions Menu* and select *View Instances*.

.. On the *Feature Gates* page, click *Create Feature Gates*.

.. Replace the code with following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec: {}
----

.. Click *Create*.

. To turn on the Technical Preview features, change the `spec` parameter to:
+
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade <1>
----
+
<1> Add `featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade` to enable the `CSIBlockVolume`, `ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation`, `MachineHealthCheck`, `RotateKubeletServerCertificate`, and `SupportPodPidsLimit` features.
+
[NOTE]
====
Turning on Technical Preview features cannot be undone and prevents upgrades.

. To turn off the Technical Preview features, change the `spec` parameter to:
+
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: FeatureGate
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec: {} <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade` with `{}` to disable the `ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation`, `MachineHealthCheck`, `RotateKubeletServerCertificate`, and `SupportPodPidsLimit` features.
+
[NOTE]
====
Turning off Technical Preview features removes the features but upgrading of your cluster remains disabled.

After creating the CR, use the following command to get the name of the CR for editing as needed:

----
$ oc get FeatureGate cluster -n openshift-config
NAME      AGE
cluster   18d
