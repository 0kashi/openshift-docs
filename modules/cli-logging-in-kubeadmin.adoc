= Logging in to the `oc` CLI with the `kubeadmin` credentials

You can log in to the `oc` command line interface (CLI) by using the
default `kubeadmin` user.

* Deploy a {product-title} cluster.
* Install the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

. Export the `kubeadmin` credentials:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/filenameineedtoget <1>
----
<1> `<installation_directory>` is the path to the directory that you stored
the installation files in.

. Log in to the `oc` CLI:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc login
----
+
Specify `kubeadmin` as the user and the password that displayed when the
installation process completed. If you no longer have the password for the `kubeadmin`
user, it is also listed in the `.openshift_install.log` file in your
installation directory.
