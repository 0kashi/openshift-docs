= Configuring Fluentd to send logs to an external Elasticsearch instance

Fluentd sends logs to the value of the `ES_HOST`, `ES_PORT`, `OPS_HOST`,
and `OPS_PORT` environment variables of the Elasticsearch deployment
configuration. The application logs are directed to the `ES_HOST` destination,
and operations logs to `OPS_HOST`.

[NOTE]
====
Sending logs directly to an AWS Elasticsearch instance is not supported. Use
Fluentd Secure Forward to direct logs to
an instance of Fluentd that you control and that is configured with the
`fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service` plug-in.
====

To direct logs to a specific Elasticsearch instance, edit the deployment
configuration and replace the value of the above variables with the desired
instance:

----
$ oc edit dc/<deployment_configuration>
----

For an external Elasticsearch instance to contain both application and
operations logs, you can set `ES_HOST` and `OPS_HOST` to the same destination,
while ensuring that `ES_PORT` and `OPS_PORT` also have the same value.

If your externally hosted Elasticsearch instance does not use TLS, update the
`_CLIENT_CERT`, `_CLIENT_KEY`, and `_CA` variables to be empty. If it does
use TLS, but not mutual TLS, update the `_CLIENT_CERT` and `_CLIENT_KEY`
variables to be empty and patch or recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with
the appropriate `_CA` value for communicating with your Elasticsearch instance.
If it uses Mutual TLS as the provided Elasticsearch instance does, patch or
recreate the *logging-fluentd* secret with your client key, client cert, and CA.

[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the provided Kibana and Elasticsearch images, you will not
have the same multi-tenant capabilities and your data will not be restricted by
user access to a particular project.
