= Manually rolling out Elasticsearch

toc::[]



<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
{product-title} is configured so that the Elasticsearch
Deployment Config object does not have a Config Change Trigger, meaning
any changes to the DeploymentConfig does not result in an automatic rollout. This prevents
unintended restarts happening in the Elasticsearch cluster, which could create excessive shard
rebalancing as cluster members restart.
>>>>>>> edit

{product-title} supports two Elasticsearch restart procedures:

* Rolling cluster restart. A rolling restart applies appropriate changes to the 
Elasticsearch cluster without down time (if three masters are configured). 
The Elasticsearch cluster remains online and operational, with nodes taken offline 
one at a time.

* Full cluster restart. A full cluster restart upgrade requires that you shut 
down and restart all nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Procedures in this topic require your cluster to be in an unmanaged state. For more information, see xref:../logging/efk-logging-configuring.html#efk-logging-elasticsearch-management-state-changing_efk-logging-configuring[Changing the cluster logging management state].
