= Enabling Device Manager

Enable Device Manager to implement a device plug-in to advertise specialized
hardware without any upstream code changes.

Device Manager provides a mechanism for advertising specialized node hardware resources 
with the help of plug-ins known as device plug-ins.

.Procedure

. Enable Device Manager support on the target node or nodes:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe configmaps <name>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe configmaps node-config-infra
...
kubeletArguments:
...
  feature-gates:
  - DevicePlugins=true
----

. Ensure that Device Manager was actually enabled by confirming that
*_/var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/kubelet.sock_* is created on the node. This is
the UNIX domain socket on which the Device Manager gRPC server listens for new
plug-in registrations. This sock file is created when the Kubelet is started
only if Device Manager is enabled.
