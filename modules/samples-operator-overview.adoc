= Understanding the Samples Operator

On initial startup, the operator creates the default samples resource to
initiate the creation of the image streams and templates. The image streams are
the RHEL based {product-title} image streams pointing to images on
registry.redhat.io. The templates are those categorized as {product-title}
templates.

The Samples Operator and configuration resources, are contained within the
`openshift-cluster-samples-operator` namespace. On startup, it copies the pull
secret captured by the installation into the OpenShift namespace with the name
`samples-registry-credentials` to facilitate image stream imports. A cluster
administrator can create any additional secrets containing the content of a
Docker `config.json` in the OpenShift namespace as needed to facilitate image
import.

The image for the Samples Operator contains image stream and template
definitions for the associated OpenShift release. Each sample includes an
annotation that denotes the OpenShift version with which it is compatible. The
operator uses this annotation to ensure that each sample matches the release
version. Samples outside of its inventory are ignored, as are skipped samples.
Modifications to any samples that are managed by the operator will be reverted
automatically. The Jenkins images are actually part of the image payload from
installation and are tagged into the image streams directly.

The samples resource includes a finalizer which cleans up the following upon
deletion:

* Operator managed image streams
* Operator managed templates
* Operator generated configuration resources
* Cluster status resources
* The `samples-registry-credentials` secret

Upon deletion of the samples resource, the Samples Operator recreates the
resource using the default configuration.
