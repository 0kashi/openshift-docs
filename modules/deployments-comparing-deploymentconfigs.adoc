= Comparing Deployments and DeploymentConfigs

Because deployment configurations existed in {product-title} prior to
deployments being added in Kubernetes 1.2, the latter object type naturally
diverges slightly from the former. The long-term goal in {product-title} is to reach
full feature parity in Deployments and switch to using them as a
single object type that provides fine-grained management over applications.

Deployments are supported to ensure upstream projects and examples that use the
new object type can run smoothly on {product-title}. Given the current feature
set of Deployments, you might want to use them instead of deployment
configurations in {product-title} if you do not plan to use any of the following
in particular:

- Image streams
- Lifecycle hooks
- Custom deployment strategies

The following sections go into more details on the differences between the two
object types to further help you decide when you might want to use Kubernetes
deployments over deployment configurations.

== DeploymentConfigs-specific features

[discrete]
==== Automatic rollbacks

Currently, Deployments do not support automatically rolling back to the last
successfully deployed ReplicaSet in case of a failure.

[discrete]
==== Triggers

Deployments have an implicit `ConfigChange` trigger in that every
change in the pod template of a deployment automatically triggers a new rollout.
If you do not want new rollouts on pod template changes, pause the deployment:

----
$ oc rollout pause deployments/<name>
----

Currently, Deployments do not support `ImageChange` triggers. A generic
triggering mechanism has been proposed upstream, but it is unknown if and when
it may be accepted. Eventually, a {product-title}-specific mechanism could be
implemented to layer on top of Deployments, but it would be more desirable for
it to exist as part of the Kubernetes core.

[discrete]
==== Lifecycle hooks

Deployments do not support any lifecycle hooks.

[discrete]
==== Custom strategies

Deployments do not yet support user-specified Custom deployment
strategies yet.

[discrete]
==== Canary deployments

Deployments do not yet run canaries as part of a new rollout.

[discrete]
==== Test deployments

Deployments do not support running test tracks.

[discrete]
==== Rollover

The deployment process for Deployments is driven by a controller
loop, in contrast to deployment configurations which use deployer pods for every
new rollout. This means that a Deployment can have as many active
ReplicaSets as possible, and eventually the deployment controller will scale
down all old ReplicaSets and scale up the newest one.

Deployment configurations can have at most one deployer pod running, otherwise
multiple deployers end up conflicting while trying to scale up what they think
should be the newest ReplicationController. Because of this, only two
ReplicationControllers can be active at any point in time. Ultimately, this
translates to faster rapid rollouts for Deployments.

[discrete]
==== Proportional scaling

Because the Deployment controller is the sole source of truth for the sizes of
new and old ReplicaSets owned by a deployment, it is able to scale ongoing
rollouts. Additional replicas are distributed proportionally based on the size
of each ReplicaSet.

Deployment configurations cannot be scaled when a rollout is ongoing because the
deployment configuration controller will end up having issues with the deployer
process about the size of the new ReplicationController.

[discrete]
==== Pausing mid-rollout

Deployments can be paused at any point in time, meaning you can also
pause ongoing rollouts. On the other hand, you cannot pause deployer pods
currently, so if you try to pause a deployment configuration in the middle of a
rollout, the deployer process will not be affected and will continue until it
finishes.
