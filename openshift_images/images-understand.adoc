Containers, container images, and image streams are important concepts
to understand when you set out to create and manage containerized software.
In short, a container image holds a set of software that is ready to run,
while a container is a running instance of a container image.
An image stream provides a way of storing different versions of the
same basic image. Those different versions are represented by different
tags on the same image name.
