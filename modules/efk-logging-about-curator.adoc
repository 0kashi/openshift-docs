= About Curator in {product-title}

As an administrator, you can use the built-in Elasticsearch Curator tool to configure scheduled Elasticsearch maintenance
operations to be performed automatically on a per-project basis. Curator performs actions daily based on its configuration. Only one Curator pod is
recommended per Elasticsearch cluster. 

For more information, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/about.html[Curator].
