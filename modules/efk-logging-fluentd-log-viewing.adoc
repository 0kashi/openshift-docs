= Viewing Fluentd logs

How you view logs depends upon the `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` setting.

* If you are using `LOGGING_FILE_PATH=console`,  Fluentd writes logs to stdout/stderr`. 
You can retrieve the logs with the `oc logs [-f] <pod_name>` command, where the `-f`
is optional, from the project where the pod is located.
+
----
$ oc logs -f <pod> <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of the Fluentd pod. Use `-f` option to follow what is being written into the logs.
+
For example
+
----
$ oc logs -f fluentd-lmvms
----
+
The contents of log files are printed out, starting with the oldest log. 

* If `LOGGING_FILE_PATH` points to a file, use the *logs* utility, from the project, 
where the pod is located, to print out the contents of Fluentd log files:
+
----
$ oc exec <pod> -- logs <1>
----
<1> Specify the name of the Fluentd pod. Note the space before `logs`.
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc exec fluentd-lmvms -- logs
----
+
To view the current setting:
+
----
oc -n openshift-logging set env daemonset/fluentd --list | grep LOGGING_FILE_PATH
----
