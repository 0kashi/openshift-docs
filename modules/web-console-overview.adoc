= Understanding the web console

The web console runs as a pod on the master. The static assets required to run
the web console are served by the pod. Administrators can also customize the web
console using extensions, which let you run scripts and load custom stylesheets
when the web console loads.

When you access the web console from a browser, it first loads all required
static assets. It then makes requests to the {product-title} APIs using the
values defined from the `oc cluster up` option `--public-master`, or from the
related parameter `masterPublicURL` in the `webconsole-config` config map
defined in the `openshift-web-console` namespace. The web console uses
WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API server and receive
updated information as soon as it is available.

The configured host names and IP addresses for the web console are whitelisted
to access the API server safely even when the browser would consider the
requests to be cross-origin. To access the API server from a web application
using a different host name, you must whitelist that host name by specifying the
`--cors-allowed-origins` option on `oc cluster up` or from the related master
configuration file parameter `corsAllowedOrigins`.

The `corsAllowedOrigins` parameter is controlled by the configuration field. No
pinning or escaping is done to the value. The following is an example of how you
can pin a host name and escape dots:

----
corsAllowedOrigins:
- (?i)//my\.subdomain\.domain\.com(:|\z)
----

* The `(?i)` makes it case-insensitive.
* The `//` pins to the beginning of the domain (and matches the double slash
following `http:` or `https:`).
* The `\.` escapes dots in the domain name.
* The `(:|\z)` matches the end of the domain name `(\z)` or a port separator `(:)`.
