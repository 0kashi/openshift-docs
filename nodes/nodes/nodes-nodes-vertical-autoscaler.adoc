The {product-title} Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator (VPA) frees you from needing to set up-to-date 
resource limits and requests for the containers in their pods. The VPA Recommender automactically
computes the recommended resource requests for pods based on historical and current usage of the resources. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Vertical Pod Autoscaler is currently a Technology Preview feature.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Red Hat
Technology Preview features support scope] for more information.
