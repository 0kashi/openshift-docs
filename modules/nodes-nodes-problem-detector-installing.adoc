. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page change the *Target* to the *global-operators* Operator Group. This makes the Operator available to all users and projects that use this OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

. On the *Catalog* → *Installed Operators* page, verify that the NodeProblemDetector (CSV) eventually shows up and its *Status* ultimately resolves to *InstallSucceeded*.

If it does not, switch to the *Catalog* → *Operator Management* page and inspect the *Operator Subscriptions* and *Install Plans* tabs for any failure or errors under *Status*. Then, check the logs in any Pods in the openshift-operators project (on the *Workloads* → *Pods* page) that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.
