= iSCSI Volume Security
Users request storage with a `PersistentVolumeClaim`. This claim only 
lives in the user's namespace and can only be referenced by a pod within 
that same namespace. Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a 
namespace causes the pod to fail.

Each iSCSI LUN must be accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
