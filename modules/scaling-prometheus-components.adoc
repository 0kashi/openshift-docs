= Scaling the prometheus components

Scale up or down the number of {product-title} Prometheus pods replicas.

.Prerequisites

* Based on you scale destination, compute and set the relevant PV size for the
Prometheus data store. Since the default Prometheus pods replicas is 2, for 100
nodes with 3600 pods you will need 188 GB. For example:
+
----
94 GB (space per 15 days ) * 2 (pods) = 188 GB free
----
+
Based on this equation, set
`openshift_cluster_monitoring_operator_prometheus_storage_capacity=94Gi`.

*Scaling up*

.Procedure

. Run:
+
----
# oc scale -n openshift-monitoring --replicas=3 statefulset prometheus-k8s
----

[NOTE]
====
* The default replicas are 2 Prometheus pods.
* If you add a new node to or remove an existing node from a Prometheus cluster,
the data stored in the cluster rebalances across the cluster.
====

*Scaling down*

.Procedure

. Run:
+
----
# oc scale -n openshift-monitoring --replicas=0 statefulset prometheus-k8s
