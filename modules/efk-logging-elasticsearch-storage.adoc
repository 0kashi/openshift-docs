= Configuring Elasticsearch storage

An Elasticsearch cluster is responsible for log aggregation. You can configure the number of Elasticsearch nodes 
in your cluster and configure persistent storage.

.Procedure

Edit or create the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR):

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "clusterlogging"

....

 spec:
    logStore:
      type: "elasticsearch"
      elasticsearch:
        nodeCount: 3
        storage:
          storageClass:
            name: "gp2"
            size: "200G"
----

This example specifies each data node in the cluster is bound to a Persistent Volume Claim that requests "200G" of AWS General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage.
