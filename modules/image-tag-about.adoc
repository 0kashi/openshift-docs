= What is a container image tag?

A *_container image tag_* is a label applied to a container image in a repository that distinguishes a specific image
from other images in an image stream. Typically, the tag represents a version number of some sort. For example, here v3.11.59-2 is the tag:

----
registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7:v3.11.59-2
----

You can add additional tags to an image. For example, an image might be assigned the tags :v3.11.59-2 and :latest.
