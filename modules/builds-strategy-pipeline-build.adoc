= Pipeline build

The Pipeline build strategy allows developers to define a _Jenkins pipeline_
for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin.
The build can be started, monitored, and managed by
{product-title} in the same way as any other build type.

Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile,
either embedded directly in the build configuration,
or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the build configuration.

The first time a project defines a build configuration using a Pipeline
strategy, {product-title} instantiates a Jenkins server to execute the
pipeline.  Subsequent Pipeline build configurations in the project share this
Jenkins server.

pipeline execution. For more information on the Jenkins image provided with
