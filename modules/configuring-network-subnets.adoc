= Configuring network subnets

All Pods are assigned IPs. This enables Pod to Pod communication and Pod to node
communication without network address translation (NAT). For a CIDR in the range
of 10.128.0.0/14, IPs in this range are, by default, assigned to the Pods. If
you want to change this, you must adjust the `ClusterNetwork`. If you want to
customize the IPs rolled out to services, then you must adjust the
`ServiceNetwork`.

.Procedure

To configure a custom IP range, also called a _subnet_, complete the following.

. Run:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir=new-install create install-config
----

. Change to the `new-install` directory:
+
----
$ cd new-install
----

. Edit the `install-config.yaml` file, setting the required fields under
`networking`:
+
----
networking:
      clusterNetwork:
        - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
          hostPrefix: 23
      machineCIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
      serviceNetwork: 172.30.0.0/16
      networkType: OpenshiftSDN
----

. Consume the customized `install-config.yaml` file to deploy the cluster:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir=new-install create cluster
----
