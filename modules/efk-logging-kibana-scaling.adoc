= Scaling Kibana for redundancy

You can scale the Kibana deployment for redundancy:

----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=2
----

[NOTE]
====
To ensure the scale persists across multiple executions of the logging playbook,
make sure to update the `openshift_logging_kibana_replica_count` in the inventory file.
