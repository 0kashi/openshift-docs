= Manually rolling out Elasticsearch

{product-title} supports two Elasticsearch restart procedures:

* Rolling cluster restart. A rolling restart applies appropriate changes to the 
Elasticsearch cluster without down time (if three masters are configured). 
The Elasticsearch cluster remains online and operational, with nodes taken offline 
one at a time.

* Full cluster restart. A full cluster restart upgrade requires that you shut 
down and restart all nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Procedures in this topic require your cluster to be in an unmanaged state. For more information, see xref:../logging/efk-logging-configuring.html#efk-logging-elasticsearch-management-state-changing-efk-logging-configuring[Changing the cluster logging management state].
