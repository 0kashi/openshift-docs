You can configure the number of Elasticsearch nodes in your cluster and configure persistent storage.

You can bind each data node in the Elasticsearch cluster to a persistent volume claim using a Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR).

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the storage block, the deployment will include ephemeral storage only.
====

The following example specifies each data node in the cluster is bound to a Persistent Volume Claim that requests 200G of General Purpose SSD (gp2) storage.

Procedures in this topic require your cluster to be in an unmanaged state. For more information, see xref:../logging/efk-logging-configuring.html#efk-logging-elasticsearch-management-state-changing-efk-logging-configuring[Changing the cluster logging management state].
