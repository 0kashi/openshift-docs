= Security Warning

{product-title} runs containers on hosts in the cluster, and in some cases, such
as build operations and the registry service, it does so using privileged
containers. Furthermore, those containers access the hosts' Docker daemon and
perform `docker build` and `docker push` operations. As such, cluster
administrators must be aware of the inherent security risks associated with
performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as they effectively have
root access. This is particularly relevant for `docker build` operations.

Exposure to harmful containers can be limited by assigning specific builds to
nodes so that any exposure is limited to those nodes.

If you have `cluster-admin` privileges, you can also use security
context constraints to control the actions that a pod can perform and what it
has the ability to access.
